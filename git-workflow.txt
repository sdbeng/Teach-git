BASIC GIT WORKFLOW
Hello Git
Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

## git init
Then we turn the directory into a Git project by doing:
>git init

The work init means initialize. This command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.

## Git workflow
A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

A Working Directory: where you'll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
A Staging Area: where you'll list changes you make to the working directory
A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory,
+additions
-deletions
modifications

Adding files to the staging area - bring changes to staging area

 and saving changes to a Git repository. In Git, we save changes with a commit, which we will learn next.

## git status
As we change the contents in the working directory, you check the status with git status.

You'll see the untracked files. Untrack means that Git sees the file but has not started tracking changes yet.
